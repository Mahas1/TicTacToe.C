# Tic Tac Toe

This program aims to implement a model of Tic Tac Toe, a game that is based on grids, Xs and Os.

### The objective of this project is to make a program that can
- display a Tic-Tac-Toe board
- accept inputs from the player
- calculate moves to respond.

### This program aims to provide the following functionality
-	Support any grid size, like 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 etc.
-	Get inputs from the player, and accept them only if they are valid inputs.
-	Print out the board with the filled squares, and make it more presentable by using coloured text.
-	Use 2-byte UTF-8 implementation of text to preserve alignment, and enhance its appearance.
-	Use an algorithm to find possible moves to counter the playerâ€™s move, and to find out any moves that might win the game for the computer.
-	Check for every move whether the player won, the computer won, or if the game is a draw.
-	Use concepts such as variables, constants, arrays, 2-D arrays, loops, functions, recursion, pointers etc.
